# Tic Tac Toe tutorial

This is simply a recreation of the tutorial for React based from their own website. 

To run, simply download all files and open `index.html`. All notes about the code is found on the comments of each `.js`

## `App_NoTimeTravel.js`
The tutorial demonstrated the use of history through `useState()` and this results in looking at the previous moves and redoing moves. To disable that option, simply rename the old `App.js` to any name and rename `App_NoTimeTravel.js` to `App.js`.
